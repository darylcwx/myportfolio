As a passionate programmer with a keen interest in UI/UX and front-end design, I couldn't resist the opportunity to create my own portfolio website. Drawing upon my years of study and professional experience, I embarked on this journey to highlight my experience in the field. I truly hope that this project will always be a WIP, because it simply means that I never stop learning and growing!`,
